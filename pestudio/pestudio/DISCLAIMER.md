‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: Use of PeStudio
.<h1>Do not install or run PeStudio for fun or out of curiosity</h1>

PeStudio is a powerful static analysis tool used to examine the structure and behavior of executable files without running them. While it is not inherently malicious,
it is commonly used in cybersecurity contexts where handling malware or suspicious files is involved.
PeStudio can expose sensitive details about how a binary interacts with the Windows OS, such as:

Imported DLLs
- API calls
- Obfuscated code patterns
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Potential stealth or evasion techniques.
- Because of this, PeStudio is also a tool that malware authors or reverse engineers might use. If misused or paired with actual malware, 
it can unintentionally bypass antivirus protections or help spread real threats.

>üë®‚Äçüíª Why Ethical Hackers Use PeStudio
Ethical hackers and malware analysts use PeStudio in controlled environments (like sandboxes or VMs) to:
- Test how Windows Defender reacts to certain binaries
- Analyze payloads or shellcode statically (without executing)
- Detect indicators of evasion or injection techniques
- Understand malware behavior before dynamic testing
- This helps in improving defense strategies and writing better detection signatures.

> ‚úÖ Safe Usage Tips
- Always use PeStudio on a virtual machine or isolated lab system.
- Never test live malware on your personal machine.
- Avoid downloading or opening suspicious .exe files from untrusted sources.

üö´ PeStudio is not a toy. Treat it with the same caution as you'd treat real malware tools. Misuse can lead to unintentional system compromise or legal trouble.
